All feedback welcome! Please review if you like it or give me feedback if something doesn't work. 

Features:

*** YouTube Playlist Creation
1. Highlight some text with multiple lines, e.g. a list of songs and click the YouSearch icon. YouSearch will search YouTube for each line of text individually and present the first result of each search in the pop-up. 
2. Click "Create Playlist" at the bottom of the pop-up. You must be logged into YouTube and allow YouSearch to access your YouTube account.
